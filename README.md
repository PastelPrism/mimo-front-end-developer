# üöÄ Mimo Front End Developer Path Projects

Hi! üëã

Last **April 2025** I got challenged to do **every web development course** we could find! A challenge I happily accepted. üéâ  
This repository contains all my projects, challenges, and extra exercises from [Mimo Front-End Developer Path](https://mimo.org/web/219/section/0?showDrawer=path-overview).
